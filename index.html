    <h2>Meet Chinedu Ogbonna</h2>
    <p>If I had to give myself a title based on my journey, it would be Autodidact. I’m someone who built a meaningful career in product marketing from a place of fear and uncertainty — and turned it into purpose and progress. With over five years of experience as a Product Marketing Manager, I've seen success, made mistakes (aka lessons), and grown through it all.But like the saying goes, “there’s something about first love.” Mine has always been Cloud Engineering. That’s why I joined AltSchool — to reconnect with that passion. One day soon, I hope to rewrite this biography and reintroduce myself as both a Product Marketing Manager and a Certified Cloud Architect.</p>

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool & What I Aim to Achieve</h2>
    <p>I joined AltSchool Africa to build a solid foundation and kickstart my career in Cloud Computing. As an autodidact, I’ve come to value structured learning — the kind that offers clear progress tracking, community support, and real-world practice. AltSchool provides exactly that. I see it as the right platform to not only learn deeply but also gain hands-on experience through internship opportunities and continuous skill development. My goal is to become a confident Cloud Engineer, ready to solve problems and build scalable solutions.</p>
